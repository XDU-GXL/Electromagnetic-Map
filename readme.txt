electromagnetic data #3, electromagnetic data #4 and electromagnetic data #5 are datasets obtained by throwing the sensing nodes in an area of 4000m*4000m with the help of Atoll 2.8.0. The Okumura-Hada model is used and the parameters are set as follows: the frequency of the radiation source is 2100MHz, the equivalent height of the receiving end is 1.5m, and the equivalent antenna height of the radiation source is 30m. They are n*4 matrices.

“magnetic data #2”
Data Format: Latitude (°), Longitude (°), Altitude (m), Magnetic Field (nT)
Notes:
(1) The magnetic field values represent the observed magnetic field in a certain sea area of eastern Hainan minus the IGRF main magnetic field;
(2) The integer parts of position longitude and latitude have been zeroed out;
(3) The data sampling frequency is 5Hz;
(4) The diurnal variation of the magnetic field has been corrected for in the data.
